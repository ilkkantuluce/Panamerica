                              [28. April 2008]
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Already in Panama City we learned to know Andrew form New Jersey who cycles to Argentina too and then adds Africa to his trip. Being an English teacher he tries to work in schools on his way through the continent(s) or just go to schools to tell students about this way of travelling. Check out his web page: <a href="http://teacherontwowheels.com/" target="_blank">http://teacherontwowheels.com/</a> 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Andrew managed to get on the same boat as we and arriving in Cartagena we were lucky to be welcomed together by our couchsufing host, Joanna. From the balcony of her flat where we slept we had a great view over the skyscrapers and the beach. A swimming pool, a maid who cooked for us, use of her computer with free internet, we were in heaven. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Together with Joanna we discovered the beautiful old town of Cartagena. In the evenings we went for a beer or two and met the people from our boat again who stayed in Cartagena too for some days. Thanks to Joanna we were invited to one of the most beautiful rooftop terraces we have ever seen; close to one of the impressive cathedrals, over the roofs of Cartagena and with a view of the sun disappearing into the sea. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          We decided to try cycling together with Andrew, as far as possible, maybe through whole Colombia. The first three days along the coast to Santa Marta Andrew learned how nice it can be to ride in the wind shade. We were fighting a hard head wind and sometimes felt like a Tour de France team alternating positions every ten kilometers. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          The reason we cycled up to the north first was to visit the famous national park of Tayrona. We decided to stay in the cosy fishermen town of Tanganga and do a day trip to the park. At the park entrance we were stopped by two policemen who wanted to check our passports. As we did not have them with us, the only possibility was to go back to Santa Marta to check at the immigration office whether we are in Colombia illegally or not! – unless, well, the police can be cooperative, if we show ourselves cooperative too... Time for our standard recital about corruption, principles and stupid tourists! After our speech the policemen were visibly embarrassed. A long silence followed and we knew: we need to give them a reason to let us go like this, otherwise they would loose their face. The only thing that came on our mind was proposing them to buy two beers when we come back from the park (which we would have forgotten then). Unfortunately they preferred to have two Cokes paid right away and we felt that we could do this. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Only minutes later we regretted what we just did. Even though two Cokes do not mean a lot to us this was the first time on our trip that we bribed someone. And it would probably not even have been necessary here as embarrassed as they were. They realized that they could not get anything from us. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Whatever, we could advance to the ticket office – only to realize there that we did not want to pay 14 Dollars each for just a walk in the national park. Angrily we turned round, passed the puzzled policemen and went back to Taganga, where we spent a peaceful afternoon on the beach. On one hand we felt bad of having missed the park, the reason why we came up here, on the other hand we felt good to have been able to say no to one of these tourist traps. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          On our first night after riding inland toward the south we decided to go camp somewhere besides the street. We asked at a farm and the workers there told us to wait until the “jefe” comes back. When the chief came and we asked him for a secure spot to set up our tents he looked at us as if we were coming from Mars. After some seconds of thinking he went some meters away and called someone on his mobile phone. After 20 minutes (!) he returned and said it was ok. But we could not pick a spot on the huge grassland, no we were guided to one of the enclosures for cattle and in there we were allowed to camp – on the concrete floor, covered with dried cow shit. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Why would they want us to be in that gated area, and why were there no cows at all? Why did he have to do so many calls to decide whether we can stay or not? And why were there so many soldiers on the farm? Ups, this is not a... of course! Colombia produces 80% of the worlds cocaine so it must be everywhere here... 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          We slept well and then decided to leave quietly without asking any questions. But it was very tempting to try to get to see their production (which is possible sometimes without taking pictures). 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          The following days we cycled over the huge flat lands towards the south. This was a totally new experience for us as we never had more than two flat days in a row on our trip so far. The Swiss-American train was rolling on full speed. The extreme heat (33°-40° during day, 24°-26° during nights) and the heavy traffic and later rain showers made the days very exhausting and we were happy to find cheap hotel rooms (three persons for between 6 and 12 Dollars) every evening. Hard work during the day, a lot of fun while exploring the Colombian cities during the evenings. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Hundred kilometers before Bucaramanga the road turned left from the plain into the mountains, our first climbs in the Andes. Our legs were very tired from the last days and we suffered on the steep hills. On one hill Andrew suddenly flew past us, smiling happily. He had catched one of the very slow climbing trucks and surfed up the hill. Pius reacted immediately and got hold of the truck too in the back of Andrew. And Stefan – well, Pius and Andrew had a soda ready when he was on top of the pass... 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Totally exhausted we arrived in Bucaramanga, the fifth biggest city in Colombia. The sightseeing was erased from our to-do-list immediately after we cycled through town to find a hotel. Bucaramanga is not nice. Old, dirty buildings, dirt everywhere and nothing special to see. Our place to go for the evening was therefore one of the big shopping malls (maybe the only clean part of the city) with a multiplex cinema and a great food court :-)

                              [12. May 2008]
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          On the day we left Bucaramanga, Pius’ stomach did not feel good. Nothing new for us as we prefer taking a little risk and therefore being able to eat whatever we like. The new thing this time was that it lasted for five days! The road between Bucaramanga and Bogota is very hilly, pure mountains. Combined with digestion problems these mountains easily double their height. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Fortunately we were in no hurry and Stefan and Andrew were nicely patient. Going a little slower meant having time to stop and watch the beautiful countryside. Shortly after Bucaramanga the nature turned from beautiful to amazing: after one long downhill we were in the famous Chicamocha Canyon, a marvel that many say is more beautiful than the Grand Canyon. We had enough time to enjoy the view as we had to climb from the bottom of the Canyon to the top of it – from 550m to 1900m. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          On our way up we spotted something we haven’t seen for a long time: another bike touring guy was cycling in front of us! We catched up to him and finished the day cycling together. Danny is from Australia and has been cycling for more than one year now through Europe and South America. We could have enlarged our bike team to four people for the next days but we soon realized that this would probably not have worked out well. Bike nomads are said to live in their own world and after many months of cycling alone some loose part of their social skills. Danny partially confirmed this prejudice and we know now how lucky we are to have such a nice (and easy) time with Andrew. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          In San Gil we returned from the wilderness of the mountains to civilisation for one day. We gave an extended interview to the local TV and newspapers, met Susanne from Switzerland (the girl who liquored us up in Portobello) again coincially and went for dinner with another Swiss girl, Nadine, and her friends from Bogota. Nadine is friends with one of our Swiss friends and we are invited to stay at here place in Bogota. Sweeet!
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          During a football game between Colombia and Venezuela (we never saw any crowd taking a friendly game so serious) we learned to know Nicolas. He is one of the few locals speaking English and we had lively conversations with him (Stefan and Andrew did, Pius was curing his stomach in the hotel room). 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Nicolas invited us on a day trip to Barrichara, an old colonial town in the mountains above San Gil. Even Pius made it up there and it was absolutely worth the pain. White washed houses, cobbled streets and a calmness as if we were hundert years back in time provided the perfect circumstances for a recreative rest day. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          After the many nights we stayed in cheap hotel rooms in the last weeks, we more and more felt a desire to sleep in the tent or some other interesting situation again. One night we spent in a classroom of a tiny school, our first time on this trip. Another night we asked for a camping spot in a communal park and, to our surprise, were offered a perfect camping spot with toilets and showers. After having cycled in Western and Eastern Europe we are more and more surprised how easy it is to find a place to stay here. Suspiciousness and refusal (widely spread in most parts of Europe) is something people here do not seem to know. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Some other days of cycling through stunning countryside brought us to the next jewel of Colombia, the colonial town of Villa de Leyva. As calm as Barrichara has been as crowded and touristic was this place. We happened to arrive on a long weekend and masses of people from nearby Bogota flooded the small town. We were very surprised to discover many of them being students. Why would so many young people leave the clubs and bars of Bogota to come to such a quiet little town? We found the answer to our question in the evening while sitting among them on the stairs overlooking the plaza: the area aroung Villa de Leyva is famous for the growing of mushrooms, the color and hallucination stimulating ones...
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          In Chiquinquira we stopped just for a lunch brake on our way to Bogota but we think we still have to mention this here. If you are a male human and you go to Colombia you should not miss this town. Just sit along the pedestrian mall and enjoy the feast for the eyes! We heard that women are very beautiful here before coming to Colombia and we saw it confirmed in the last three weeks but this place took it to another dimension. Bad timing for us, cycling was waiting...
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          In Zipaquira we visited the salt cathedral, said to be one of the top tourist attractions of Colombia. Even though we had to shock our guide by admitting not to belong to any relegion we were still allowed to visit the holy shrine deep underground in an old salt mine. Three large halls cut out of nearly pure salt form the cathedral. Everything is lit in blue light and the combination of feeling in a mine and in a church at the same time was quite exciting. One piquant detail: a fourth hall right by the chruch is used as a convention center. This place frequently houses rock concerts and techno parties – sin and sainthood, door to door...
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Bogota welcomed us everything else than warmly. For the first time since Mexico (Jan 08) we had to put on our raingear; only shortly but twice this day! The weather is cold up here on 2600m and the exhaust of cars and trucks seems to be more agressive in this thin air. All three of us got sore throats after this day of riding, Pius even catched a full-grown cold that lasted for several days. We are not used to this weather anymore, after several months of heat and sunshine along the Caribbean...
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          After an involuntary city tour by bikes (in vain looking for the right address) we were finally welcomed in Nadines beautiful flat, right in the middle of the Zona Rossa, the party and fashion center of Bogota. We took the chance of having a good kitchen and prepared a Lasagna for Nadine & friends. The big cooking-test was still to come though: cook “Roeschti & Zuerigschnaetzlets”, this time for Swiss gourmet-connoisseurs!
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Usually we don’t touch our bikes during our days off in a big city. We prefer walking, taking the bus or a Taxi, just not cycling. On Sunday in Bogota we had a good reason to make an exception from this rule: Cyclovia. Main roads in and around the center of Bogota are closed to motorized traffic and thousands of people use the free space for cycling, walking or inline skating. It was a superb feeling to roll gently on the huge roads that are usually full of traffic. Every Sunday people from Bogota can enjoy this freedom. Why isn’t this possible in Zurich too?

                          As much as we like Colombia until now as terrible it’s big cities seem to us. As it was the case in Bucaramanga it now it is the same in Bogota. The traffic is insane and it fills the air with a nearly unbearable exhaust. Combined with the cold weather this causes our throats to fill with slime and our heads seem to explode after a walk through the city.

                          The Zona Rossa is impressive during Saturday night, full of people drinking in bars and clubs and the old center has some colonial charm, but an atmosphere like in Cartagena or Panama City was not to be discovered by us. Time to get on the bike!

                              [31. May 2008]
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Bogota lies on an altitude of 2600 meters, Fusagasuga, only 32 kilometers further down the road is on 400 meters. For once a downhill was a real downhill; hardly any climbs disturbed us while flying down into the hot valley. What we could not imagine some hours earlier up in the cold weather of Bogota became reality quite fast now: temperature was increasing from minute to minute and we ended up in the heat of the Magdalena valley. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          During the days in Bogota we were looking forward to the hot weather while fighting our sore throats. Now that we were back in the heat we wished it to be a little cooler… The heat is not a problem while riding, the wind cools us down. It is on the last kilometers of the day and during the evenings that we feel how much more tired we get under these conditions. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          So we were flying along the Magdalena valley, fighting the kilometers with only one goal: arriving at the place to stay as soon as possible, have a cold beer, and do nothing for the rest of the day. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          One day we were stopped by the police – the first time in Colombia. Was it because we were listening to music while riding (which we do only very few times) or because we were riding too much in the center of the road? We were already preparing our arguments… Once more we were too suspicious about Colombia. The policemen only asked us a lot about our trip, where we are going, told us to be careful in certain areas and we promised them to spend the night in the next big city. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          When we arrived there we were stopped again by the police – friends of the other policemen whom they radioed after meeting us. They welcomed us to their city and brought us to another friend’s house where we could spend the night. This is the police of Colombia, your friend and helper! This is Colombia: nice people and no problems instead of all the horror stories we heard about this country. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          The impressive natural phenomenon of the Tatacoa desert near Neiva gave us a reason for another day off. The surrounding mountains somehow keep the rain off this place and this results in a mini-desert. Riding towards the desert was through green fields but then, from one kilometer to the other, we were surrounded by red sand hills. The taxi driver who brought us to the desert offered to guide us through the channels of the eroded sand labyrinth instead of waiting for us in his cab – really Colombian!
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Yes, we are impressed by Colombia, by the people who welcome us with their always friendly smile everywhere and we feel completely comfortable here. Maybe too comfortable… when we stopped at a viewpoint to take pictures we did not really watch our bikes and Pius even left the pannier open after he got the camera out. We were becoming negligent and we were punished! We thought these were just some other guys staring at our bikes with disbelief (like so many people do), but they seemed to be very interested in the electronic translator that was on top of the open pannier… When we returned to the bike Pius immediately realized that something was missing but we decided our chances to catch the guys on their motorbikes with our bikes were not good. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          The good things: 1.) we learned our lesson and we know we still have to be careful. 2.) there where other things in that bag that would have been much harder to replace (GPS, MP3 player). 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          The following days brought us back into the mountains. This meant a lot of climbing but also we were getting into the cooler air we were longing for during the past days. On some of the steep hills we definitely (and not the first time) had confirmed what we always thought and have to explain to so many people: <b>recumbents are not much harder to ride uphill than normal bikes</b>. Or how else would we have been able to ride up slopes with our recumbents and 31.7 resp. 32.2 kilos of luggage that Andrew pushed up his bike with his 12 (no joking, he changes coins into bills for weight reasons) kilos of luggage? Yes, we may be ready to suffer a little more but we can not be that much stronger to compensate 20 kilos of luggage AND a big recumbent-factor, no?
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Our next goal was San Augustin, the archeological capital of Colombia. People who know us know that we are not interested in some old stones lying around on a hill… So why could we be looking forward so much to San Augustin? “Casa de Ciclistas” is the magical word. Igel and Paola from Germany (<a href="http://www.grenzenlos.ath.cx/" target="_blank">http:// www.grenzenlos.ath.cx/</a>
                          ) bought a nice <i>finca</i> close to San Augustin and this place is open to cycling travelers to come by, stay and relax. They are on another bike trip right now but Dala and Theo, two Colombians living on the property, welcomed us and showed us the building besides the main house that seems to be built for bikers only: own kitchen, amenities, rooftop terrace and a quietness we didn’t experience for quite a while (because we were sleeping close to the main road often). A paradise for worn-out bikers like we were when we arrived – and were not at all anymore when we left. Our batteries were refilled, our minds cleared from all the noise and exhaust, ready to hit the road again. Thank you Igel and Paola!
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          A big surprise was waiting for us on the last day in San Augustin. We were walking through town and then we saw these strange things… we think it were bicycles… but somehow strange… Tom and Denise from Germany on their recumbent bikes (<a href="http://www.tour-en-blog.de" target="_blank">http://www.tour-en-blog.de/</a>)! There was only one evening to talk about all the common experiences, problems and stories that we share, especially as recumbent bike riders. We hope to see them again in Quito.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Our batteries were full again but we did not really use them when we left. Our friends in Bogota warned us about the security situation in the mountains between San Augustin and Popayan. In San Augustin the locals considered the situation with the rebels as not dangerous anymore. As we wanted to stay on the safe side and as the road on this stretch is in a very bad condition we decided to take a bus or a truck for these 120 kilometers. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Waiting on the road to Popayan for half an hour without any truck and only full busses passing by we felt our confidence melt away… When a medium size bus (20 seats) stopped, we thanked the driver for the nice move but pointed towards our bikes and explained the impossibility of fitting them into this bus. What a <i>Gringo</i> thinking! Andrew’s bike disappeared into the trunk (with wheels disassembled), one recumbent was soon squeezed behind the drivers seat and the second recumbent first blocked the aisle and later was moved towards the rear seats of the bus. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          How lucky we were to be on this bus instead of some open bus (so called chicken bus) or truck we realized when we came into the rain zone above 2800 meters. Up there the rain hardly ever stops and the dirt of the road has been washed away to leave bare stones to make up the road. We enjoyed the warm seats and prayed for our bikes to survive this bumpy ride.

                          In Popayan we surfed the ultimate couch. Camilo and his parents live in one of the nicest houses we ever had the honor to set foot into. Both parents are architects and they fulfilled their dream of a spectacular house with surroundings that resemble a park more than a private garden. “The couch” is a separated room with two big beds and a private bathroom. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          The ultimate experience was not the house and the garden though but the family that welcomed us. A mix of Colombian friendliness and many years of experience in traveling and receiving guests made us feel like being at home. During the Colombian dinner (prepared by the family) and the Swiss dinner (prepared by us) we had the chance to refresh our Spanish, something we did not do often in the past weeks. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Being there on a Saturday evening we went out to learn to know Popayan’s night life with Camilo. After meeting the Colombian salsa champion in a famous salsa dancing club (and leaving soon again as we know how our salsa dancing looks like) we went to another typical party-and-dancing place. Once more we had to experience that Colombians are incredibly friendly and open-hearted but when it comes to going out things get more complicated. They either go out in groups of friends or as single couples (something that is not at all common in Switzerland) and they stay in these groups for the whole evening. The only chance for us to learn to know people in such situations would be to ask girls to dance. But you just heard at what level our dancing skills are…

                          Back to cycling. The road from Popayan to Ipiales, close to the boarder with Ecuador, is said to be one of the most beautiful ones in Colombia. True. But then there is this other thing that guidebooks do not usually write about: during five days we had to climb hills like crazy. An average climbing of 1500 meters per day resulted – that’s like cycling over the Swiss Alps daily!
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          We could have enjoyed the landscape even more if there weren’t these clouds covering the sky. Large parts of Colombia suffer under heavy floodings and landslides at the moment; it rains and rains… You might know how we usually treat rain: we don’t get into it :-) Ok, there was half an hour of rain once during cycling but it was on one of the hard climbs and the drops just evaporated on our heated bodies. During the night it always poured like crazy. That’s why we did not camp a lot during these days but stayed in cheap hotels or in the houses of friendly Colombians. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          In Ipiales we took the day off our legs really needed. We scaled down our expectations before we visited “Las Lajas”, the most famous church of Colombia, built over an impressive gorge. Still we were disappointed by what we saw: just another church with the same kitsch that appears in too many churches around here. The construction over the gorge is quite impressive though, but this impression was suppressed by the hundreds of metal plates that were plastered on the rocks around the church. The pathetic and often ridiculous sentences that they contain and the huge amount of money they must have cost to the persons who bought them showed us once more how ridiculously blind and imprudent “intensely lived Christianity” (and other religions?) can make. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          Ipiales is our last town in Colombia. This means: the last friendly Colombian smiles, the last <i>Papas Rellenas</i> and <i>Empanadas</i> (food specialties), the last <i>Vallenato</i> songs, the last beautiful Colombian women – my god, how we will miss this country! It came like it was predicted by all the people who have been here before: we loved this place.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                          As many good things as we heard about Colombia as critical were the voices concerning Ecuador: Dogs more aggressive, weather always rainy and cold, reserved and dull people, even crazier climbs… We will see.
